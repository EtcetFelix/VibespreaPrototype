Prototype app to communicate with others peer to peer over bluetooth at music festivals where thereâ€™s no signal due to over congestion.

Made this in 2022 and didn't upload to github back then. 
Uploaded all related files in 11/11/2024.

I scrapped the project due to realizing I didn't care about going to music festivals anymore and didn't want to spend more time developing a project I wouldn't personally use.
